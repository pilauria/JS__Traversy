<h1>Factory pattern</h1>

<font size="4"> A way of creating an interface for creating objects where we let subclasses define which classes to instantiate.

(We provide a generic interface that delegates the responsibility of object instantiation to its subclasses).

Factory methods are often used in applications to manage, maintain and manipulate collections of objects that are different, yet have many common characteristics.<br/>

And a good example of that would be a member, let's say, some kind of paid membership application or website where your members may have different types but still have the same properties and methods. </font>
